# COVID-19-Arport-facility
An airport healthcare project that will help India prevent, detect, respond and prepare for the pandemic and strengthen its public awareness. Used Python to write the program and Excel sheet to store data of each passenger. Travel history of each passenger in the past three months was taken into consideration and all the people who might have come in contact with the person at the airport. Also if the person shows symptoms he/she would be transferred to the nearest hospital.
